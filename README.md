# Default Courses template

This template is based on [Bulma css](https://bulma.io/). The official courses [documentation page](http://antonmeskildsen.github.io/courses) also uses this template.

## Setup
It is assumed that you already have Courses installed. Otherwise, check out the installation guide [here](https://coursesproject.github.io/courses).

Then run the following command to create a new Courses project with the default template:

```bash
courses init <name>
```

## Documentation

The template comes with an index page containing more information on how to use the included shortcodes `figure` and `message`. Run `courses serve` to serve the page locally.
